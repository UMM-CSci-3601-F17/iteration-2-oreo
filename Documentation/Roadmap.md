## Roadmap for SAGE

## New Features

Add ability to edit cards:
* It would be convienient to edit cards so that they wouldn't have to be deleted and
created again or if a teacher wanted to make an adjustment.

CSV importing of Cards:
* Allowing cards and decks to be imported as CSV's would make content creation much faster and easier.

Add ability for teachers to add whitelisted e-mails:
* This feature would let a teacher add an e-mail to an input box rather than needing them
to add the email to the system itself or contact a developer.

Card list should filter by cards that are in and not in a deck based on if you would like to add or remove cards to it:
* This would make it more clear on what cards are actually in the deck or not. There would probably be a dropdown that
you would choose if you wanted to add or remove cards from a deck, and the list would only show cards that are in the deck if you
were in delete mode, and would only show cards that are not in the deck for add mode.

Cards are removable from the deck page:
* It would be more intuitive to let cards be deleted from the deck page.

Button on the results pop-up that will allow another game to be played with the same settings:
* This would make it faster to return to playing if no settings were desired to be different for the game.

## Known Issues

Screen responsiveness (Some devices can scroll):
* It would be ideal to make it so the page doesn't scroll on any devices, both for aesthetics and so that users would not get confused.

No Double colors when selecting in the color screen:
* Currently, a color can be picked by multiple players and we think it would be better to limit it to one unique color per player
to avoid potential confusion.

More obvious animations when a color has been selected for a player:
* It isn't very obvious right now when a player has chosen a color for themselves, so more feedback when a color is
selected would be beneficial.

Card list does not render properly on internet explorer:
* The cards are rendered in a single column down the screen rather than 4 or 5 columns, which is not how the page
was intended to look.

If the Got it Button is pressed too fast, the page will have an error:
* The button must be pressed quite rapidly, and it will not crash the whole system, but the game would need to be restarted,
which is inconvienient.

Symbols can be put into the number of cards input on the start page:
* Math symbols are considered valid input in this box which can cause an error (empty play page).

Get Whitelist to work:
* Anyone can login right now, not just teachers, and this needs to be fixed so that students can't delete cards and decks
from the system or make cards or decks with bad words.
