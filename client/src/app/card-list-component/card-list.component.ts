/*
The cardList component has numerous instance variables. The cards to be displayed in the view are actually
"SimpleCards" which only include the word of a card and its ID, and not hints associated with the full card.
The mode of the card list can be either "View" or "Select". When clicking a card in view mode, a request to
the server will be made for all of the information in that card, and will display it in a popup dialog.
When a card is pressed in select mode, it will be highlighted and placed into the selectedCards array.
The card list also retrieves the names and ids of all of the decks in the system as SimpleDecks. clearAllSelected
will indicate in a for loop to all of the simpleCard components displayed on the screen that they should set
their selected variable to false. The selectedDeck variable will give the server a target to add or remove
cards from. selectedCards are also passed to the server to indicate which cards should be
added or removed from a deck. The selectedButton variable lets the component distinguish between when it is in select or view mode based
on what the last button pressed was. Finally, cardWords are kept track of separately so that they can be shown
on a dialog for what changes have been made to a deck.
