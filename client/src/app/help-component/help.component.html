                <li>It is played with two people. One person is shown a card which has a word on it and will try to use
                    a sentence to guess what that word means.
                </li>
                <li>The other person can decide if they are correct or not, and can give them hints.</li>
                <li>If you can guess the word correctly without needing any hints, you'll earn five points!</li>
                <li>If you are playing with your partner on one screen, your partner can press the peek button to see
                    all of the hints without changing your points.
                </li>
                <li>To start a game, press play from the homepage, choose your deck, and press play!</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="content-hints">
                <li>Each word comes with four hints of different kinds that can be given:</li>
                <li>The first type of hint is a synonym, which is a word that means the same thing as another.</li>
                <li>The second kind of hint is an antonym, which is a word that means the opposite as another.</li>
                <li>The third type is called a General Sense. This hint is a sentence that explains what the word
                    means.
                </li>
                <li>The fourth kind is an Example of the word. It is also a sentence which uses the word inside of it.
                </li>
                <li>Every word has one hint of each of these types that can be randomly shown to your partner if you get
                    stuck on a word.
                </li>
                <li>Every time you need a hint you'll lose a point though, so watch out!</li>
