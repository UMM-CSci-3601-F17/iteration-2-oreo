                    How to Play the Game

            <ul>
                <li>It is played with two people, a judge and guesser. The guesser is shown a card which has a word on it and will try to use a sentence to guess what that word means.</li>
                <li>The judge decides if they are correct or not, and will give them up to four hints when requested.</li>
                <li>If the guesser can guess the word correctly without needing any hints, they earn five points.</li>
                <li>However, each hint asked for, will cost one point form the perfect five.</li>
                <li>A card always gains the guesser one point.</li>
                <li>While playing on one screen, the judge can press the peek button to see all of the hints without changing your points.</li>
                <li>To start a game, press play from the homepage, choose a deck, and press play!</li>
            </ul>

                </mat-panel-title>
            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <ul>
                <li>Each word comes with four hints of different kinds that can be given:</li>
                <li>The first type of hint is a synonym, which is a word that means the same thing as the word on the card.</li>
                <li>The second kind of hint is an antonym, which is a word that means the opposite as the word on the card.</li>
                <li>The third type is called a General Sense. This hint is a sentence that explains what the word means.</li>
                <li>The fourth kind is an Example usage of the word. It is a sentence which uses the word inside of it.</li>
                <li>Every word has one hint of each of these types that can be randomly shown to the guesser if they get stuck on a word.</li>
                <li>Every time the guesser needs a hint they'll lose a point though, so watch out!</li>
            </ul>
